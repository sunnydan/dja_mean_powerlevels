# Powerlevels

Create an app which a user can input a power level value between 1-100 in the input tag. Present the user 6 sections that use the power level value, multiply it by a specific multiplier and display the adjusted value.

For this assignment, we can store the value of the power in our PowerComponent, and we can use the @Input() feature to pass our power level into each of the sub components. The Sub components may now take the inputted power level, manipulate it and present it on the template.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
